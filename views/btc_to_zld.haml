    To buy ZLD just send your BTC to this wallet:
    = succeed '.' do
      %code= address
    Once your payment is completed in the Bitcoin network, you will get ZLD
    to your wallet.
    You can send a payment to this address only once and only within the next
    = succeed '!' do
      %strong= "#{(30 - (Time.now - settings.addresses.mtime(confirmed_user.login)) / 60).round} minutes"
    When the payment is received, you will find a new address for the next payment, at this page.
